2,Bajan cou cou with spicy fish,"Marinade 60g fresh coriander 35g fresh parsley 2 stalks celery, roughly chopped 3 spring onions, chopped 5 garlic cloves half a small onion 2.5cm (1 inch) chunk of fresh ginger, peeled 4 sprigs thyme 4 red mild chillis 2 teaspoons lime juice 650g white fish fillets (such as coley, cod or pollock), cleaned and washed Fish sauce 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 small onion, sliced half a yellow pepper, deseeded and cut into strips half a red pepper, deseeded and cut into strips 2 sprigs fresh thyme 400g tin chopped tomatoes 1 small scotch bonnet pepper, finely chopped (optional) 0.5 teaspoon salt (optional) Cou cou 200g cornmeal powder 100g raw okra, diced 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 600ml water","Add the parsley, celery, spring onion, onion, ginger, 4 sprigs of fresh thyme, red chilli and lime juice to a food processor and pulse several times to give a coarse green marinade. Put the fish fillets in a bowl, then pour in the mixture. Turn and brush the fish well to make sure it's completely covered by the marinade. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or even overnight).
To make the sauce, heat the oil in a large pan and add the onions and peppers. Cook for about 5 minutes on medium heat until they have started to soften and turn golden. Then add the remaining 2 sprigs of thyme and the scotch bonnet (if using), and cook for 1 more minute. Add the marinated fish, tomatoes and salt, gently stir and spoon the sauce over the fish. Turn the heat down to low, cover the pot and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. While the fish is cooking, make the cou cou. Add the cornmeal to a mixing bowl and slowly add just enough cold water to cover it. Use a wooden spoon to mix to a smooth paste, with no dry lumps visible. Set this cornmeal paste aside.
Put the diced okra in a pot with about 400ml of water. Bring to a medium boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes until the okra softens. Use a sieve or colander to drain the okra, making sure to keep the hot okra water. Put the okra aside, then pour about a quarter of the hot okra water back into the pan and the rest into a jug.
With the heat on low, gradually add a quarter of the soaked cornmeal mixture to the okra water in the pot, and whisk to a smooth paste. Add the oil to the mixture and whisk well, before gradually adding the rest of the okra water and cornmeal. Whisk continuously until all the cornmeal and liquid is well mixed and smooth.
Switch to a wooden spoon and keep mixing the cornmeal for another 2 or 3 minutes. It will start to bubble and thicken, so will need mixing harder to avoid lumps. At this point add the cooked okra and mix for another few minutes, or until the okra is well incorporated though the cornmeal, and then remove from the heat. Scatter the chopped parsley over the fish, and serve with the cou cou.",410kcal,"37.3g protein 48g carbohydrate, of which 11.1g sugars 5.2g fat, of which 0.3g saturates 7.3g fibre 1.3g salt",4
3,Baked potatoes with mince,"4 baking potatoes, scrubbed clean 250g extra-lean minced beef 1 small onion, finely chopped 1 garlic clove, crushed 1 handful cup or button mushrooms, finely chopped 100ml reduced-salt vegetable stock 1 teaspoon tomato purée Side salad 1 handful shredded lettuce leaves 1 medium red onion, sliced 1 handful cherry tomatoes","Preheat the oven to 200°C, fan 180°C, gas mark 6. Prick potatoes all over with a fork before baking for 1 hour, or until tender. Carefully push a sharp knife into the centre to check they're soft. If you have a microwave, you can save time (and money) by cooking the potatoes in there instead. Put the pricked potatoes on a microwave-safe plate and cook on full power for 4 minutes. Turn them over and repeat for a further 4 minutes, or until cooked through.

Meanwhile, heat a large saucepan and add the mince, a handful at a time, cooking until browned. You can use any type of mince you like for this – pork or turkey work well, as does vegetarian mince.

Add the onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute, then add the mushrooms, stock and tomato purée. Stir well until hot, then simmer, part-covered, for 20 to 25 minutes.

Once everything's ready, split the baked potatoes open and divide the filling between them. Serve with some watercress, or the lettuce, onion and tomato side salad.

Any leftover mince goes great in a wrap, topped with a spoon of low-fat plain natural yoghurt and a grating of lower-fat cheese. Let it cool and store in an airtight container in the fridge, and use within 3 days.
